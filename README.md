# iati-budgets
Repository to investigate the effect of Ukraine on aid financing. Currently, this is just a repository to store budget data to compare to future budget data, allowing us to see changes in priorities which may or may not stem from diverted financing.

You will need to create an account at https://developer.iatistandard.org/ and put your API_KEY in a .env file. This can be done easily on VS Code or similar.
